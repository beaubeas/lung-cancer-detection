# Microsoft SQL Server Handler

This is the implementation of the Microsoft SQL Server handler for MindsDB.

## Microsoft SQL Server
Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network.

## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the `pymssql` library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `host`: host name or IP address
* `port`: port used to make TCP/IP connection
* `database`: database name
* `user`: database user
* `password`: database password

## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to Microsoft SQL Server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mssql_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'mssql',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 1433,
  "database": "master",
  "user": "sa",
  "password": "password"
};
```
