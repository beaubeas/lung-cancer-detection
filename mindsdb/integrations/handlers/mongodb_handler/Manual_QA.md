## Testing MongoDB Handler with [Cars Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars.)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```
db.databases.insertOne({
  name: "cars_db", // database name
  engine: "mongodb", // database engine 
  connection_args: {
    "port": 27017, // default connection port
    "host": "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@clusterml.ighwwuf.mongodb.net/test", //connection host
    "database": "cars_db" // database connection          
    }
});
```

  name: "cars_predictor", 
  predict: "Selling_Price", 
  connection: "cars_db", 
  "select_data_query": "db.cars.find()"
});
```
