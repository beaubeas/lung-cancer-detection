## Manual QA Testing for EdgelessDB Handler

# Explaining the test

The test is performed on a local machine.EdgelessDB works on top of a MySQL database. So, we have to install MySQL
first. Then, we have to install EdgelessDB. After that, we have to create a database in EdgelessDB. Finally, we have to
test the database by creating a table and inserting some data into it.
EdgelessDB is designed to work for SGX enviroment. Because i don't have SGX enviroment, i have to run EdgelessDB in
simulation mode. In simulation mode, EdgelessDB runs as a normal MySQL database. So is important to note that the test
is performed on a normal MySQL database.

1. Testing CREATE DATABASE without encryption option of EdgelessDB

```sql
CREATE DATABASE edgelessdb_datasource
    WITH ENGINE = "EdgelessDB",
    PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "test123@!Aabvhj",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "test_schema"
    }
```

The result is as follows:

2. Testing CREATE DATABASE with encryption option of EdgelessDB

```sql
CREATE DATABASE edgelessdb_datasource2
    WITH ENGINE = "EdgelessDB",
    PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "test123@!Aabvhj",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3306,
    "database": "test_schema",
    "ssl_cert": "/home/marios/demo/cert.pem",
    "ssl_key": "/home/marios/demo/key.pem"

    }
```

The result is as follows:

...

n. Testing SELECT FROM edgelessdb_datasource

```sql
select *
from edgelessdb_datasource2.meetings
```

### Results

Drop a remark based on your observation.

- [x] Works Great ðŸ’š (This means that all the steps were executed successfuly and the expected outputs were returned.)
- [x] Further Testing Required ðŸŸ¡ (This means that the test was not performed under every possible scenario. It is
  recommended to perform also th tests in an SGX compatible system and also in Microsoft Azure.)
