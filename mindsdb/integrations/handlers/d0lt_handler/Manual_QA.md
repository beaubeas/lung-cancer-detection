## Testing DoIt Handler with [Pumpkin Seeds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/pumpkin-seeds-dataset)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE d0lt_handler            --- display name for database
WITH engine = 'd0lt',                   --- name of the mindsdb handler 
parameters = {
    "user": "demo_user",                --- Your database user
    "password": "demo_password",        --- Your password
    "host": "cloud.mindsdb.com",        --- host, it can be an ip or an url
    "port": 3306,                       --- common port is 3306
    "database": "files"                 --- The name of your database
};
```

![CREATE_DATABASE](create-db.png)

**2. Testing CREATE PREDICTOR**

```sql
CREATE PREDICTOR mindsdb.pumpkin_predictor
FROM d0lt_handler (
    SELECT * FROM pumpkin_seeds_data
) PREDICT Class;
```

![CREATE_PREDICTOR](create-predictor.png)

**3. Testing SELECT FROM PREDICTOR**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM mindsdb.models
WHERE name='pumpkin_predictor';
```

![SELECT_FROM](predict-target.png)
