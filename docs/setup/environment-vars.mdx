title: Environment Variables
---

Most of the MindsDB functionality can be modified by extending the default configuration, but some of the configuration options 
can be added as environment variables on the server where MindsDB is deployed.

## MindsDB Storage 

By default, MindsDB stores the configuration files by determining appropriate platform-specific dirs, e.g. a "user data dir": 

* On Linux `~/.local/share/mindsdb/var`
* On MacOS `~/Library/Application Support/mindsdb/var`
* On Windows `C:\Documents and Settings\<User>\Application Data\Local Settings\<AppAuthor>\mindsdb\var`

In the `MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR` location, MindsDB stores users' data, models and uploaded data files, the static assets for the frontend application and the 
`sqlite.db` file. 
You can change the default storage location using `MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR` variable.

#### Example

```
MINDSDB_STORAGE_DIR='~/home/mindsdb/var'
```
