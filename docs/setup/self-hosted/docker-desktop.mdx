## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed Docker Desktop, following the [official Docker Desktop documentation](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

## Setup

This setup of MindsDB uses the `mindsdb/mindsdb:latest` Docker image, which is a lightweight Docker image of MindsDB that comes with [these integrations preloaded](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/staging/default_handlers.txt).

Follow the steps to set up MindsDB in Docker Desktop.

## Install MindsDB

Go to the Extensions page in Docker Desktop and search for MindsDB.

Install the MindsDB extension.

<Tip>
It is recommended to pull the latest image of the MindsDB Docker image in order to make sure that you are running the latest version of MindsDB as part of the Docker Desktop extension. 

To do this, follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to the 'Images' tab in Docker Desktop.
2. Search or locate the mindsdb/mindsdb:latest image.
3. Click on the three dots on the right side of the image and click 'Pull'. If the image is already up to date, you will see a message stating so and you can skip the next step.
4. Wait for the image to be pulled and restart Docker Desktop.
