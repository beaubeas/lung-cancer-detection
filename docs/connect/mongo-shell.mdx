MongoDB Shell is the quickest way to connect and work with MongoDB.

MindsDB provides a powerful MongoDB API, allowing users to connect MindsDB to the [MongoDB Shell](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell). Please note that connection to MongoDB API provided by MindsDB is the same as connection to a MongoDB database.

## Overview

Here is an overview of the connection between MindsDB and MongoDB Compass:

</p>

Let's go through the steps presented above:

1. We connect MongoDB Compass to MindsDB. It is discussed in the following content.

2. We connect MindsDB to a database. You can use the [`CREATE DATABASE`](/sql/create/databases) statement to accomplish this step.

3. Having completed steps 1 and 2, you can access the connected database from MongoDB Compass through MindsDB.

## How to Connect

Here is how to connect MongoDB Compass to MindsDB using either MindsDB Coud or local installation.

In both cases, you can run the below command from MongoDB Shell, providing all connection details, such as host, port, username, and password, to create a connection from MongoDB Shell to MindsDB.

```bash
mongo --host [hostname] --port [TCP/IP port number] -u [user] -p [password]
```

    Here is how to connect to a local MindsDB installation:

    ```bash
    mongo --host 127.0.0.1 --port 47336
    ```

    Let's look at an example:

    ```bash
    mongo --host cloud.mindsdb.com -u zoran@mindsdb.com -p
    ```

    On execution, we get:

    ```bash
    MongoDB shell version v4.0.28
    Enter password:
    connecting to: mongodb://cloud.mindsdb.com:27017/?gssapiServiceName=mongodb
    Implicit session: session { "id" : UUID("b2afbba1-ddfd-4379-944f-asdasaasd") }
    MongoDB server version: 4.0.28
    ```

    Here is how to connect to MindsDB Cloud.

    ```bash
    mongo --host cloud.mindsdb.com -u mindsdb_cloud_username -p mindsdb_cloud_password
    ```

    Please replace the `mindsdb_cloud_username` placeholder with your MindsDB Cloud account email. You can replace the `mindsdb_cloud_password` placeholder with your MindsDB Cloud password or run the command without it and pass the password at runtime, as below.

    ```bash
    mongo --host cloud.mindsdb.com -u mindsdb_cloud_username -p
    ```
