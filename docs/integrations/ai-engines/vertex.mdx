This allows you to bring any Vertex AI model as a virtual AI-Table that you can query via SQL and JOIN with data from any datasource.

## Setup

You will need to get the service_account.json and copy the content in the corresponding <strong> service account </strong> attribute: 

```sql
create ml_engine vertex from vertex
using 
project_id="mindsdb-401709",
location="us-central1",
staging_bucket="gs://my_staging_bucket",
experiment="my-experiment",
experiment_description="my experiment description",
service_account = {
  ...
};
```

<Tip>
To create a service_account.json follow the following steps: 

 - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
 - On the top left there is a blue "create credentials" button click it and select "service account key." (see below if its not there)
 - Choose the service account you want, and select "JSON" as the key type.
 - It should allow give you a json to download
</Tip>

## Bring your model as an AI-Table

Create model, in this example, assuming that you have a model called 'diamonds_anomaly_detection' in Vertex:

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.vertex_anomaly_detection_model
PREDICT cut
USING 
    engine = 'vertex',
    model_name = 'diamonds_anomaly_detection',
    custom_model = True;
```

## Use your model

Call prediction (for example in bulk predictions using JOIN)

```sql
SELECT t.cut, m.cut as anomaly
FROM files.vertex_anomaly_detection as t
JOIN mindsdb.vertex_anomaly_detection_model as m;
```
