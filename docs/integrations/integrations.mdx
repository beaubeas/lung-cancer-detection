There are two types of integrations to mindsdb.

 - <strong> [Datasources](/datasources/overview) </strong> These are all the datasources that you can plug to mindsdb, they can be traditional databases, and data that is behind APIs. It is important that MindsDB does no ETL pipelines, when you query a datasource MindsDB forwards this query in real-time to the original datasource, MindsDB is very good at translating SQL to any other query dialect.
 - <strong> [AI-Engines](/ai-engines/overview) </strong> These are all the possibilities you have for AI/ML Modeling, from Generative AI to traditional ML and Auto-ML.
