This documentation describes the integration of MindsDB with [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/), a cloud data warehouse used to store and analyze data.
The integration allows MindsDB to access data stored in the Snowflake database and enhance it with AI capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. Install MindsDB locally via [Docker](/setup/self-hosted/docker) or [Docker Desktop](/setup/self-hosted/docker-desktop).
2. To connect Snowflake to MindsDB, install the required dependencies following [this instruction](/setup/self-hosted/docker#install-dependencies).

<Tip>
Please note that, if you are using Docker to run MindsDB, before installing the dependencies for this integration as per the instructions given above, it is currently necessary to install Git in the container. To do this, run the following commands:

Start an interactive shell in the container:
```bash
docker exec -it mindsdb_container sh
```
If you haven't specified a name when spinning up the MindsDB container with `docker run`, you can find it by running `docker ps`.

Install Git:
```bash
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install git
``` 

The need to perform this step will be removed in future versions of MindsDB.
</Tip>

## Connection

Establish a connection to your Snowflake database from MindsDB by executing the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE snowflake_datasource
WITH
    ENGINE = 'snowflake',
    PARAMETERS = {
        "account": "uvwxyz123.us-west.gcp",
        "user": "user",
        "password": "password",
        "database": "test_db"
    };
```

Required connection parameters include the following:

* `account`: The Snowflake account identifier. This [guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier) will help you find your account identifier.
* `user`: The username for the Snowflake account.
* `password`: The password for the Snowflake account.
* `database`: The name of the Snowflake database to connect to.

Optional connection parameters include the following:

* `warehouse`: The Snowflake warehouse to use for running queries.
* `schema`: The database schema to use within the Snowflake database. Default is `PUBLIC`.
* `role`: The Snowflake role to use.

## Usage

Retrieve data from a specified table by providing the integration name, schema, and table name:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM snowflake_datasource.schema_name.table_name
LIMIT 10;
```

Run Snowflake SQL queries directly on the connected Snowflake database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM snowflake_datasource (

    --Native Query Goes Here
    SELECT
        employee_table.* EXCLUDE department_id,
        department_table.* RENAME department_name AS department
    FROM employee_table INNER JOIN department_table
        ON employee_table.department_id = department_table.department_id
    ORDER BY department, last_name, first_name;

);
```

<Note>
The above examples utilize `snowflake_datasource` as the datasource name, which is defined in the `CREATE DATABASE` command.
