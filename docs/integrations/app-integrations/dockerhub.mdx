In this section, we present how to connect Docker Hub repository to MindsDB.

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the world's easiest way to create, manage, and deliver your team's container applications.

XXX

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the `requests` library that makes http calls to https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/api/latest/#tag/resources.

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `username`: Username used to login to DockerHub.
* `password`: Password used to login to DockerHub.

<Tip>
Read about creating an account [here](https://hub.docker.com/).

Here is how to connect to Docker Hub using MindsDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_dockerhub
WITH ENGINE = 'dockerhub',
PARAMETERS = {
  "username": "username",
  "password": "password"
};
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/dockerhub_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
