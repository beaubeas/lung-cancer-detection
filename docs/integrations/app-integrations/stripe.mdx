This is the implementation of the Stripe app handler for MindsDB.

[Stripe](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/what-is-stripe) is a payment services provider that lets merchants accept credit and debit cards or other payments.

## Connection

This handler was implemented using [stripe-python](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-python), the Python library for the Stripe API.

There is only one parameter required to set up the connection with Stripe:
- `api_key`: a Stripe API key.

<Tip>
You can find your API keys in the Stripe Dashboard. [Read more](https://stripe.com/docs/keys).
</Tip>

To connect to Stripe using MindsDB, the following CREATE DATABASE statement can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE stripe_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'stripe',
PARAMETERS = {
  "api_key": "sk_..."
};
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB locally via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually. To do so, go to the handler's folder (mindsdb/integrations/handlers/mediawiki_handler) and run this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

## Usage

Now, you can query the data in your Stripe account (customers, for example) as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM stripe_datasource.customers
```

You can run more advanced queries to fetch specific customers in a defined order:

```sql
SELECT  name, email
FROM stripe_datasource.customers
WHERE currency = 'inr'
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 5
```

### Supported tables

The following tables are supported by the Stripe handler:

- `customers`
- `products`
- `payment_intents`
