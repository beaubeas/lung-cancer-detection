In this section, we present how to connect YouTube to MindsDB.

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) is a popular online video-sharing platform and social media website where users
can upload, view, share, and interact with videos created by individuals and organizations from around the world.

Comment Data from YouTube can be utilized within MindsDB to train AI models and chatbots based on user comments,
detect sentiment of comments, or use AI models to create replies.

## Connection

First, we have to install the required python packages.
```bash
pip install mindsdb[youtube]
```

<Tip>
If you installed MindsDB from a locally cloned repo via pip, you need to install all handler dependencies manually.
    To do so, go to the handler's folder `mindsdb/integrations/handlers/youtube_handler` and run this command: `pip
    install -r requirements.txt`.
</Tip>

This handler is implemented using the `google-api-python-client` library, the python library supporting YouTube v3 API.

The only required argument to establish a connection are as follows:

* `youtube_api_token` which is a Google API key used for authentication.

<Tip>
Check out [this guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key) on how to create the API key in
    order to access YouTube data.
</Tip>

The first step is to create a database with the new `youtube` engine using the following command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_youtube
WITH ENGINE = 'youtube',
PARAMETERS = {
  "youtube_api_token": "<your-youtube-api-key-token>"
};
```

## Usage

Use the established connection to query the comments table

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.comments
WHERE video_id = "raWFGQ20OfA";
```

Advanced queries for the YouTube handler

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.comments
WHERE video_id = "raWFGQ20OfA"
ORDER BY display_name ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

Given a channel_id, get information about the channel

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.channels
WHERE channel_id="UC-...";
```

Here, `channel_id` column is mandatory in the where clause.

Get information about any YouTube video using video_id:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mindsdb_youtube.videos
WHERE video_id="id";
```

`video_id` is a mandatory column in the where clause.
