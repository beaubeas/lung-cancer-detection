[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a social news website that provides a platform for users to publish articles and discuss about various topics. It was created by the startup incubator Y Combinator.

## Connection

This handler is implemented using the official Hacker News API. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to access the Hacker News API.

There are no connection arguments required.

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Hacker News to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:
