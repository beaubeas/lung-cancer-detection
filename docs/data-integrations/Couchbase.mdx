# Couchbase Handler

This is the implementation of the Couchbase handler for MindsDB.

## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the `couchbase` library, the Python driver for Couchbase.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `host`: the host name or IP address of the Couchbase server
* `bucket`: the port to use when connecting with the Couchbase server
* `user`: the user to authenticate the user with the Couchbase server
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user with the Couchbase server
* `scope`: the scope to use for making queries based on a scoped context because, couchbase uses scope just like schema in mysql, but scopes are mandatory. N.B the scope is optional, if ommited, will default to `_default`

## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to a Couchbase server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,
```sql
CREATE DATABASE couchbase_datasource
WITH
engine='couchbase',
parameters={
    "host": "localhost",
    "bucket":"test-bucker",
    "user": "admin",
    "password": "password"
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,
```sql
SELECT * FROM couchbase_datasource.collection
```
