The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `protocol`: the protocol to query Databend. Supported: native, http, https. Default: native'.
* `host`: the host name or IP address of the ClickHouse server. NOTE: use \'127.0.0.1\' instead of \'localhost\' to connect to local server.
* `port`: the TCP/IP port of the ClickHouse server.
* `user`: the username used to authenticate with the ClickHouse server.
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user with the ClickHouse server.
* `database`: the database name to use when connecting with the ClickHouse server.

There are several optional arguments that can be used as well,
* `protocol`: The protocol to query the ClickHouse server. Supported: native, http, https. Default: native'.

## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to ClickHouse in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,
```sql
CREATE DATABASE clickhouse_datasource
WITH
engine='clickhouse',
parameters={
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": "9000",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "test_db"
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,
```sql
SELECT * FROM clickhouse_datasource.example_tbl
```
