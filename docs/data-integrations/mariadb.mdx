## MariaDB

MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system (RDBMS), intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License.
MariaDB is intended to maintain high compatibility with MySQL, with library binary parity and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands, allowing it in many cases to function as drop-in replacement for MySQL.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `mysql-connector`,  a self-contained Python driver for communicating with MariaDB servers using MySQL.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `user`: database user
* `password`: database password
* `host`: host IP address or URL
* `port`: port used to make TCP/IP connection
* `database`: database name *optional.

There are several optional arguments that can be used as well.

* `ssl`: the `ssl` parameter value indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`)
* `ssl_ca`: SSL Certificate Authority
* `ssl_cert`: SSL certificates
* `ssl_key`: SSL keys

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to MariaDB in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE maria_datasource            --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'mariadb',                    --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                              --- host IP address or URL
  "port": ,                                 --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "database": " ",                          --- database name
  "user": " ",                              --- database user
  "password": " ",                          --- database password
  "ssl": ,                                  --- optional, the `ssl` parameter value indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`)
  "ssl_ca": {                               --- optional, SSL Certificate Authority
    "path": " "                                 --- either "path" or "url"
  },
  "ssl_cert": {                             --- optional, SSL certificates
    "url": " "                                  --- either "path" or "url"
  },
  "ssl_key": {                              --- optional, SSL keys
    "path": " "                                 --- either "path" or "url"
  }
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows.

```sql
SELECT * FROM maria_datasource.example_table
```
