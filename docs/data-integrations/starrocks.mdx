# StarRocks Handler

This is the implementation of the StarRocks handler for MindsDB.

# StarRocks

StarRocks is the next-generation data platform designed to make data-intensive real-time analytics fast and easy. It delivers query speeds 5 to 10 times faster than other popular solutions. StarRocks can perform real-time analytics well while updating historical records. It can also enhance real-time analytics with historical data from data lakes easily. With StarRocks, you can get rid of the de-normalized tables and get the best performance and flexibility.


# Usage

  In order to make use of this handler and connect to a StarRocks database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

  ```sql

CREATE DATABASE starrocks_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'starrocks',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "user": "starrocks_user",
  "password": "password",
  "port": 8030,
  "database": "starrocks_db"
};

  ```
  Now, you can use this established connection to query your table as follows,

  ```sql
  
SELECT * FROM starrocks_datasource.loveU LIMIT 10;

  ```
