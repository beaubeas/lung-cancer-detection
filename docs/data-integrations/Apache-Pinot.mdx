## Apache Pinot Handler
This is the implementation of the Apache Pinot handler for MindsDB.

## Apache Pinot

Apache Pinot is a real-time distributed OLAP database designed for low-latency query execution even at extremely high throughput. Apache Pinot can ingest directly from streaming sources like Apache Kafka and make events available for querying immediately.

## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the pinotdb library, the Python DB-API and SQLAlchemy dialect for Pinot.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,

host: the host name or IP address of the Apache Pinot cluster
broker_port: the port that the Broker of the Apache Pinot cluster is running on
controller_port: the port that the Controller of the Apache Pinot cluster is running on
path: the query path
Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to a Apache Pinot cluster in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pinot_datasource
WITH
engine='pinot',
parameters={
    "host":"localhost",
    "broker_port": 8000,
    "controller_port": 9000,
    "path": "/query/sql",
    "scheme": "http"
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,

```sql
SELECT * FROM pinot_datasource.example_tbl
```
