#Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to a OrioleDB server in 
MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE orioledb_data
WITH ENGINE = "orioledb",
PARAMETERS = { 
  "user": "root",
  "password": "root",
  "host": "hostname",
  "port": 5432,
  "database": "postgres"
}

#Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orioledb_data.loveU LIMIT 10;
```
