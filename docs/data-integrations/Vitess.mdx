# Vitess Handler

This is the implementation of the Vitess handler for MindsDB.

# Vitess

Vitess is a database solution for deploying, scaling and managing large clusters of open-source database instances. It currently supports MySQL and Percona Server for MySQL. It's architected to run as effectively in a public or private cloud architecture as it does on dedicated hardware. It combines and extends many important SQL features with the scalability of a NoSQL database.


# Usage

  In order to make use of this handler and connect to a Vitess database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

  ```sql

CREATE DATABASE vitess_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'vitess',
PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "user": "vitess_user",
    "password": "password",
    "port": 33577,
    "database": "vitess_db"
};

  ```
  Now, you can use this established connection to query your table as follows,

  ```sql

  SELECT * FROM vitess_datasource.product LIMIT 10;
  ```
