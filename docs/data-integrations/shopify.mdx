This is the implementation of the shopify data handler. It is responsible for fetching data from shopify and converting it into a format that can be used by the rest of the application.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

- `shop_url`: a required URL to your Shopify store.
- `access_token`: a required access token to use for authentication.

Watch this video on creating a Shopify access token [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f_aiC5oTNc&t=302s).

## Usage

In order to use the Shopify data handler, you must first create a new instance of the handler.You can do it by the following query:

~~~~sql
CREATE DATABASE shopify_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'shopify',
PARAMETERS = {
  "shop_url": "your-shop-name.myshopify.com",
  "access_token": "shppa_..."
};
~~~~

Once you have created the database, you can query it like any other database. For example:

~~~~sql
SELECT *
FROM shopify_datasource.products
limit 10
~~~~
