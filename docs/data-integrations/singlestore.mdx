# SingleStore Handler

This is the implementation of the SingleStore handler for MindsDB.

## SingleStore
SingleStore is a proprietary, cloud-native database designed for data-intensive applications. A distributed, relational, SQL database management system that features ANSI SQL support, it is known for speed in data ingest, transaction processing, and query processing.

## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the `mysql-connector-python` library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `host`: host name or IP address
* `port`: port used to make TCP/IP connection
* `database`: database name
* `user`: database user
* `password`: database password

## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to SingleStore in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,
```sql
CREATE DATABASE singlestore_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'singlestore',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 3306,
  "database": "singlestore",
  "user": "root",
  "password": "password"
};
```
