# TiDB Handler

This is the implementation of the TiDB handler for MindsDB.

## TiDB
TiDB is an open-source NewSQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing workloads. It is MySQL compatible and can provide horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability.

## Implementation
This handler was implemented using the `mysql-connector-python` library.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `host`: host name or IP address
* `port`: port used to make TCP/IP connection
* `database`: database name
* `user`: database user
* `password`: database password

## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to TiDB in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,
```sql
CREATE DATABASE tidb_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'tidb',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 4000,
  "database": "tidb",
  "user": "root",
  "password": "password"
};
```
