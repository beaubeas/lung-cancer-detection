##Oracle handler

This is the implementation of the Oracle handler for MindsDB.

##Implementation
This handler is implemented using the oracledb library. Please install it before using this handler:

pip install oracledb

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `host`: the host name or IP address 
* `port`: the TCP/IP port number
* `sid`: the unique identifier of the database instance
* `user`: the database username 
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user 

##Usage
The following syntax can be used, in order to connect to the Oracle DB:

CREATE DATABASE oracle_datasource         --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'oracle',                   --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                            --- host name or IP address
  "port": ,                               --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "sid": " ",                             --- unique identifier of the database instance
  "user": " ",                            --- database user
  "password": " "                         --- database password
};

The connection accepts either sid or service_name arguments to target to the right DB instance.

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows:

SELECT * FROM oracle_db.my_table
