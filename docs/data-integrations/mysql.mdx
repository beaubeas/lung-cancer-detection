## MySQL
MySQL is a fast, reliable and scalable open source database. MySQL has been in development for more than 25 years and has been used in many production environments since.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `mysql-connector-python` library. It's a Python client for MySQL that doesn't depend on any MySQL C libraries.

The required arguments to establish a connection are:

* `user`: database user
* `password`: database password
* `host`: host IP address or URL
* `port`: port used to make TCP/IP connection
* `database`: database name *optional.

There are several optional arguments that can be used as well.

* `ssl`: the `ssl` parameter value indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`)
* `ssl_ca`: SSL Certificate Authority
* `ssl_cert`: SSL certificates
* `ssl_key`: SSL keys

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to MySQL in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mysql_datasource            --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'mysql',                      --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                              --- host IP address or URL
  "port": ,                                 --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "database": " ",                          --- database name
  "user": " ",                              --- database user
  "password": " ",                          --- database password
  "ssl": ,                                  --- optional, the `ssl` parameter value indicates whether SSL is enabled (`True`) or disabled (`False`)
  "ssl_ca": {                               --- optional, SSL Certificate Authority
    "path": " "                             --- either "path" or "url"
  },
  "ssl_cert": {                             --- optional, SSL certificates
    "url": " "                              --- either "path" or "url"
  },
  "ssl_key": {                              --- optional, SSL keys
    "path": " "                             --- either "path" or "url"
  }
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows.

```sql
SELECT * FROM mysql_datasource.example_table
```
