# Airtable Handler

  This is the implementation of the Airtable handler for MindsDB.

# Airtable

  In short, Airtable is a platform that makes it easy to build powerful, custom applications. These tools can streamline just about any process, workflow, or projectâ€”and best of all, you can build them without   ever learning to write a single line of code.

# Usage

  In order to make use of this handler and connect to an Access database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

  ```json

  CREATE DATABASE airtable_datasource
  WITH
  engine='airtable',
  parameters={
    "base_id": "dqweqweqrwwqq",
    "table_name": "iris",
    "api_key": "knlsndlknslk"
  };

  ```
  Now, you can use this established connection to query your table as follows,

  ```json

  SELECT * FROM airtable_datasource.example_tbl

  ```
  At the moment, only ***SELECT*** queries are allowed to be executed through ***duckdb***. This, however, has no restriction on running machine learning algorithms against your data in Airtable using
  ***CREATE PREDICTR*** statements.
