This is the implementation of the TrinoDB handler for MindsDB.

## TrinoDB
Trino is an apache 2.0 licensed, distributed SQL query engine, which was forked from the original Presto project whose Github repo was called PrestoDB. As such, it was designed from the ground up for fast queries against any amounts of data.

## syntax
MindsDB lets you connect to your favorite databases, data warehouses, data lakes, etc., via the CREATE DATABASE command.

The MindsDB SQL API supports creating connections to integrations by passing the connection parameters specific per integration.

Letâ€™s review the syntax for the CREATE DATABASE command of TrinoDB.

```sql

CREATE DATABASE trino_datasource          --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'trino',                    --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                            --- host name or IP address
  "port": ,                               --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "auth": " ",                            --- optional, authentication method, currently only `basic` is supported
  "http_scheme": " ",                     --- optional, `http`(default) or `https`
  "user": " ",                            --- database user
  "password": " ",                        --- database password
  "catalog": " ",                         --- optional, catalog
  "schema": " "                           --- optional, schema
  "with":                                 --- optional, default WITH-clause (properties) for ALL tables
                                              --- this parameter is experimental and might be changed or removed in future release
};

```


## Example 1
```sql
CREATE DATABASE trino_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'trino',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8080,
  "user": "trino",
  "password": "password",
  "catalog": "default",
  "schema": "test"
};
```
## Example 2

```sql

CREATE DATABASE trino_datasource
WITH ENGINE = 'trino',
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 443,
  "auth": "basic",
  "http_scheme": "https",
  "user": "trino",
  "password": "password",
  "catalog": "default",
  "schema": "test",
  "with": "with (transactional = true)"
};

```

## Querying

SELECT * FROM trino_datasource;

where trino_datasource is database.
