## QuestDB

This is the implementation of the QuestDB data integration for MindsDB.

## Implementation

This handler is implemented using the `psycopg` library. Please install it before using this handler `version >= 1.15.3`:

```bash
pip install psycopg
```

The required arguments to establish a connection are,

- `host`: the host name or IP address
- `port`: the TCP/IP port number
- `user`: the database username
- `password`: the password to authenticate the user
- `database`: the database name

## Usage

The following syntax can be used, in order to connect to the QuestDB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE quest_datasource   --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'questdb',           --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",             --- host name or IP address
  "port": "8812",                  --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "user": "admin",                 --- database user
  "password": "quest",             --- database password
  "database": "databse_name",      --- database name
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM quest_datasource.my_table
```
