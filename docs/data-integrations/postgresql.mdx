This is the implementation of the PostgreSQL data handler for MindsDB.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) is a powerful, open-source, object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.

## Implementation

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `user` is the database user.
* `password` is the database password.
* `host` is the host name, IP address, or URL.
* `port` is the port used to make TCP/IP connection.
* `database` is the database name.

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to the PostgreSQL database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE psql_datasource
WITH
    ENGINE = 'postgres',
    PARAMETERS = {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "postgres",
    "user": "postgres",
    "password": "password"
    };
```

You can use this established connection to query your table as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM psql_datasource.demo_table
LIMIT 10;
```

## Postgres API

The Postgres API enables users to connect to MindsDB using the PostgreSQL protocol.

To run MindsDB with the Postgres API alongside it, use the below command:

```bash
python -m mindsdb --api http,mysql,postgres
```

And here is how to run the Postgres API alone:

```bash
python -m mindsdb --api postgres
```

To connect MindsDB in PostgreSQL, use the `psql` client program:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 55432 -d mindsdb -U mindsdb
```

We use the local MindsDB installation with the following parameters:
* host: `localhost`
* port: `55432`
* database: `mindsdb`
* user: `mindsdb`

<Note>
**Current Support**

There are many things that aren't supported yet.

Right now you can use psql to connect to a local mindsdb instance. You can also use psycopg and other clients, although DBeaver is finicky.

You can run simple one off queries using this psql client, and BEGIN COMMIT blocks should work. Dialect support for Postgres is ongoing, we currently back up into our generic SQL / MySQL parser.
