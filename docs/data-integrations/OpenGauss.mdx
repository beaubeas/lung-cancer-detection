## OpenGauss

  built on Huawei's years of experience in the database field and continuously provides competitive features tailored to 
  enterprise-grade scenarios.

## Usage
  
  In order to make use of this handler and connect to an Access database in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

  ```json

  CREATE DATABASE opengauss_datasource            --- display name for the database
  WITH ENGINE = 'opengauss',                      --- name of the MindsDB handler
  PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                                    --- host name or IP address
  "port": ,                                       --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "database": " ",                                --- database name
  "user": " ",                                    --- database user
  "password": " ",                                --- database password
  };

  ```
## Example

  ```json

  CREATE DATABASE opengauss_datasource
  WITH ENGINE = 'opengauss',
  PARAMETERS = {
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 5432,
  "database": "opengauss",
