This is the implementation of the CrateDB handler for MindsDB.

## CrateDB
CrateDB is a distributed SQL database management system that integrates a fully searchable document-oriented data store. It is open-source, written in Java, based on a shared-nothing architecture, and designed for high scalability. CrateDB includes components from Lucene, Elasticsearch and Netty.


## Implementation
This handler was implemented using `crate`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on CrateDB.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `user`: username associated with database
* `password`: password to authenticate your access
* `host`: host to server IP address or hostname
* `port`: port through which connection is to be made
* `schema_name`: schema name to get tables from

    _Note: Default value of schema_name is 'doc'_

## Usage
In order to make use of this handler and connect to CrateDB in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,
```sql
CREATE DATABASE crate_datasource
WITH
engine='crate',
parameters={
    "user":"crate",
    "password":"",
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port":4200,
    "schema_name":"doc"
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,
```sql
SELECT * FROM crate_datasource.demo;
```
