##PlanetScale 

This is the implementation of the PlanetScale data integration for MindsDB.

##Implementation
This handler is implemented using the planetscaledb library. Please install it before using this handler:

The required arguments to establish a connection are,
* `host`: the host name or IP address 
* `port`: the TCP/IP port number
* `sid`: the unique identifier of the database instance
* `user`: the database username 
* `password`: the password to authenticate the user

##Usage
The following syntax can be used, in order to connect to the PlanetScale DB:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE planetscale_datasource     --- display name for the database
WITH ENGINE = 'planet_scale',              --- name of the MindsDB handler
PARAMETERS = {
  "host": " ",                             --- host name or IP address
  "port": ,                                --- port used to make TCP/IP connection
  "user": " ",                             --- database user
  "password": " ",                         --- database password
  "database": " "                          --- database name
};
```


You can then use this datasource to query your database, like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM planetscale_datasource.my_table
```
