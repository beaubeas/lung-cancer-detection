#TimescaleDB Handler

This is the implementation of the TimescaleDB handler for MindsDB.

##TimescaleDB
TimescaleDB is an open-source relational database that is optimized for time-series data. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and enables you to query and analyze data in real-time. TimescaleDB can be used for a wide range of applications, including IoT, finance, and monitoring.

##Implementation
This handler was implemented using the psycopg2 library, which is a PostgreSQL adapter for the Python programming language. TimescaleDB is built on top of PostgreSQL and therefore can be accessed using the same client libraries and APIs.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,

*`host`: the host name or IP address of the TimescaleDB server
*`port`: the port to use when connecting with the TimescaleDB server
*`database`: the database name to use when connecting with the TimescaleDB server
*`user`: the user to authenticate the user with the TimescaleDB server
*`password`: the password to authenticate the user with the TimescaleDB server

##Usage
Before attempting to connect to a TimescaleDB server using MindsDB, ensure that it accepts incoming connections. The following can be used as a guideline to accomplish this,
https://docs.timescale.com/latest/getting-started/setup/remote-connections/

In order to make use of this handler and connect to a TimescaleDB server in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

```sql
CREATE DATABASE timescaledb_datasource
WITH
engine='postgres',
parameters={
    "host": "examplehost.timescaledb.com",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "example_db",
    "user": "example_user",
    "password": "my_password"
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,

```sql
SELECT * FROM timescaledb_datasource.example_tbl
```
