## Description

The `RETRAIN` statement is used to retrain the already trained predictors
with the new data. The predictor is updated to leverage the new data in
optimizing its predictive capabilities.

Retraining takes at least as much time as the training process of the predictor
did because now the dataset used to retrain has new or updated data.

## Syntax

Here is the syntax:

```sql
RETRAIN mindsdb.[predictor_name];
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.058 sec)
```

## When to `RETRAIN` the Model?

It is essential to `RETRAIN` the predictor whenever the `update_status`
column value from the `mindsdb.models` table is set to `available`.

The `update_status` column value is set to `available` when MindsDB is updated to a new version that is not backward-compatible with the existing models.
Then, the existing models become obsolete and must be retrained.

To find out whether you need to retrain your model, query the
`mindsdb.models` table and look for the `update_status` column.

Here are the possible values of the `update_status` column:

- `available` - it indicates that the model should be updated,
- `updating` - it indicates that the retraining process of the model takes place,
- `up_to_date` - it indicates that your model is up to date and does not need to be retrained.

Also, it is advised to `RETRAIN` the predictor whenever the training data was updated or added.

## Example

Let's look at an example using the `home_rentals_model` model.

First, we check the status of the predictor.

```sql
SELECT name, update_status
FROM mindsdb.predictors
WHERE name = 'home_rentals_model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------------------+---------------+
| name               | update_status |
+--------------------+---------------+
| home_rentals_model | available     |
+--------------------+---------------+
```

The `available` value of the `update_status` column informs us that the new data
is available, and we can retrain the model.

```sql
RETRAIN mindsdb.home_rentals_model;
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.058 sec)
```

Now, let's check the status again.

```sql
SELECT  name, update_status
FROM mindsdb.predictors
WHERE name = 'home_rentals_model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------------------+---------------+
| name               | update_status |
+--------------------+---------------+
| home_rentals_model | updating      |
+--------------------+---------------+
```

And after the retraining process is completed:

```sql
SELECT  name, update_status
FROM mindsdb.predictors
WHERE name = 'home_rentals_model';
```

On execution, we get:

```sql
+--------------------+---------------+
| name               | update_status |
+--------------------+---------------+
| home_rentals_model | up_to_date    |
+--------------------+---------------+
```
