## Description

The `UPDATE FROM SELECT` statement updates data in existing table. The data comes from a subselect query.
It can be used as alternative to 'create table' and 'insert into' for store predictions in distinct columns of existing rows

## Syntax

Here is an example:

```sql
UPDATE
    int2.table2
SET
    predicted = source.result,
FROM
 (
     SELECT p.result, p.prod_id, p.shop_id
      FROM int1.table1 as t
     JOIN mindsdb.pred1 as p
 ) AS source
WHERE
    prod_id = source.prod_id
    and shop_id = source.shop_id
```

And the steps followed by the syntax:

- It executes query from 'FROM' block to get the output data.
  In our example it is join of table _table1_ (from integration _int1_) with predictor _pred1_.
  It also can be select from integration
- _source_ is the alias for fetched data
- then it updates _table2_ from _int2_ using conditions from `WHERE` block and fields for update from `SET` block
  - under the hood it splits input data to rows and execute this query for every row:
  ```sql
  UPDATE
      table2
  SET
      predicted = <row.result>,
  WHERE
      prod_id = <row.prod_id>
      and shop_id = <row.shop_id>
  ```

<Tip>
It is recommended to use the primary key column(s) in the WHERE clause, as the primary key column(s) uniquely 
identify each row. Otherwise, the UPDATE statement may lead to unexpected results by altering rows that you didn't 
want to affect.
