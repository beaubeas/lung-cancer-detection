sidebarTitle: Create a Data Integration Doc Page
---

Currently, all the supported data integrations are listed [here](/data-integrations/all-data-integrations).

We plan to provide extensive instructions on how to connect and use each of the data integrations. Thus, each data integration requires its dedicated doc page.

Please follow the steps below to create a dedicated doc page for your chosen data integration.

## Step 1. Create a File

Create a file under the `mindsdb/docs/data-integrations` directory and name it with the database name.

For example, if you implement a doc page for the Amazon Redshift database, name the file as `amazon-redshift.mdx`.

## Step 2. Implement the Content

Here are the resources you should use to implement the content of the doc page:

- Use the connection template and example from [here](/data-integrations/all-data-integrations).

    For example, if you implement a doc page for the Google BigQuery database, use [this chapter](/data-integrations/all-data-integrations#google-bigquery).

- Check out the dedicated handler folder [here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers).

    For example, if you implement a doc page for the Google BigQuery database, go to [its handler folder here](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/tree/staging/mindsdb/integrations/handlers/bigquery_handler). Pay attention to the `readme.md` file, as it contains valuable information that should be included in the doc page.

You are welcome to provide usage examples of the data integrations in MindsDB!

## Step 3. Create a PR

Once you are done, create a PR. We'll review it soon!
