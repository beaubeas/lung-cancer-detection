The Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature lets you upload your own models in the form of a Python code and use them within MindsDB.

<Note>
Please note that this feature is available for MindsDB Pro users. If you have a free demo account, you'll be asked to upgrade to a dedicated AWS instance.

## How It Works

You can upload your custom model via the MindsDB editor by clicking `Add` and `Upload custom model`, like this:

</p>

Here is the form that needs to be filled out in order to bring your model to MindsDB:

</p>

Let's briefly go over the files that need to be uploaded:

* The Python file stores an implementation of your model. It should include the `args` argument in the `train` and `predict` methods, as below:

    ```py
    class CustomPredictor():
        def train(self, df, target_col, args=None):
        ...
        
        def predict(self, df, args=None):
        ...
    ```

* The requirements file stores all dependencies along with their versions.

Once you upload the above files, please provide an engine name.

Please note that your custom model is uploaded to MindsDB as an engine. Then you can use this engine to create a model.

</p>

Let's look at an example.

## Example

We upload the custom model, as below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/byom_pro_account.png" />
</p>

Once the model is uploaded, it becomes an ML engine within MindsDB. Now we use this ML engine to create a model as follows:

```sql
CREATE MODEL custom_model
FROM my_integrations
    (SELECT * FROM my_table)
PREDICT target
USING
    ENGINE = 'custom_ML_engine';
```

Let's query for predictions by joining the custom model with the data table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_integration.my_table as d
JOIN custom_model as m;
```
