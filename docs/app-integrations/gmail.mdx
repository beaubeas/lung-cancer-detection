In this section, we present how to integrate a Gmail account with MindsDB.

<Warning>
Please note that currently you can connect your Gmail account to local MindsDB installation by providing a path to the credentials file stored locally.

If you want to connect your Gmail account to MindsDB Cloud, you can upload the credentials file, for instance, to your S3 bucket and provide a link to it as a parameter.
</Warning>

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials_file` stores the Google account credentials. Follow the instructions below to generate the credentials file.
* `scopes` define the level of access granted. It is optional and by default it uses 'https://.../gmail.compose' and 'https://.../gmail.readonly' scopes.

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Google Calendar app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_gmail
WITH ENGINE = 'gmail',
parameters = {
    "credentials_file": "mindsdb/integrations/handlers/gmail_handler/credentials.json",
    "scopes": ['https://.../gmail.compose', 'https://.../gmail.readonly', ...]
};
```

<Tip>
You need a Google account in order to use this integration. Here is how to get the credentials file:

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard.
2. In the `Enabled APIs & services` tab, click on `Enable APIs and Services` button, search for `Gmail API`, and enable it.
3. In the `OAuth consent screen` tab, create a new project and an app:
    - name your project,
    - choose user type as external,
    - add app name and user support email,
    - add the following scopes: `.../auth/userinfo.profile`, `.../auth/userinfo.email`, `openid`,
    - add a test user,
    - save and go back to the dashboard.
4. In the `Credentials` tab, click on `Create Credentials` button and choose `OAuth client ID`:
    - choose application type as `Desktop app` and give it a name,
    - click on `Create`,
    - download the JSON file.
</Tip>

## Usage

This creates a database called mindsdb_gmail. This database ships with a table called emails that we can use to search for emails as well as to write emails.

Now you can use your Gmail data, like this:

* searching for email:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM mindsdb_gmail.emails
    WHERE query = 'alert from:*@google.com'
    AND label_ids = "INBOX,UNREAD"
    LIMIT 20;
    ```

* writing emails:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO mindsdb_gmail.emails (thread_id, message_id, to_email, subject, body)
    VALUES ('187cbdd861350934d', '8e54ccfd-abd0-756b-a12e-f7bc95ebc75b@Spark', 'test@example2.com', 'Trying out MindsDB',
            'This seems awesome. You must try it out whenever you can.');
    ```

## Example 1: Automating Email Replies

Now that we know how to pull emails into our database and write emails, we can make use of OpenAPI engine to write email replies.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.gpt_model
PREDICT response
USING
    engine = 'openai',
    max_tokens = 500,
    api_key = 'your_api_key', 
    model_name = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
    prompt_template = 'From input message: {{body}}\
                        by from_user: {{sender}}\
                        In less than 500 characters, write an email response to {{sender}} in the following format:\
                        Start with proper salutation and respond with a short message in a casual tone, and sign the email with my name mindsdb';
```

## Example 2: Detecting Spam Emails

You can check if an email is spam by using one of the Hugging Face pre-trained models.

```sql
CREATE MODEL mindsdb.spam_classifier                           
PREDICT PRED                           
USING
  engine = 'huggingface',              
  task = 'text-classification',        
  model_name = 'mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-sms-spam-detection', 
  input_column = 'text_spammy',        
  labels = ['ham', 'spam'];
```

Then, create a view that contains the snippet or the body of the email.

```sql
CREATE VIEW mindsdb.emails_text AS(
    SELECT snippet AS text_spammy
    FROM mindsdb_gmail.emails
);
```

Finally, you can use the model to classify emails into spam or ham:

```sql
SELECT h.PRED, h.PRED_explain, t.text_spammy AS input_text
FROM mindsdb.emails_text AS t
JOIN mindsdb.spam_classifier AS h;
```
