This is the implementation of the Gmail app handler for MindsDB. todo

Gmail is todo

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials_file` is todo

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Google Calendar app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_gmail
WITH ENGINE = 'gmail',
parameters = {
    "credentials_file": "mindsdb/integrations/handlers/gmail_handler/credentials.json",
    -- "scopes": ['SCOPE_1', 'SCOPE_2', ...] -- Optional scopes. By default 'https://.../gmail.compose' & 'https://.../gmail.readonly' scopes are used
};
```

## Usage

This creates a database called mindsdb_gmail. This database ships with a table called emails that we can use to search for emails as well as to write emails.

Now you can use your Gmail data, like this:

* searching for email:

    ```sql
    todo
    ```

* writing emails:

    ```sql
    todo
    ```
