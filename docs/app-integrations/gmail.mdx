In this section, we present how to integrate a Gmail account with MindsDB.

<Warning>
Please note that currently you can connect your Gmail account to MindsDB only when using local MindsDB installation.
</Warning>

## Connection

The required arguments to establish a connection are as follows:

* `credentials_file` stores the Google account credentials. Follow the instructions below to generate the credentials file.
* `scopes` define the level of access granted. It is optional and by default it uses 'https://.../gmail.compose' and 'https://.../gmail.readonly' scopes.

In order to make use of this handler and connect the Google Calendar app to MindsDB, the following syntax can be used:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mindsdb_gmail
WITH ENGINE = 'gmail',
parameters = {
    "credentials_file": "mindsdb/integrations/handlers/gmail_handler/credentials.json",
    "scopes": ['https://.../gmail.compose', 'https://.../gmail.readonly', ...]
};
```

<Tip>
Here is how to get the credentials file:

1. Configure the OAuth consent screen following [this instruction](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent).
2. Create service account credentials following [this instruction](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#choose_the_access_credential_that_is_right_for_you).
</Tip>

## Usage

This creates a database called mindsdb_gmail. This database ships with a table called emails that we can use to search for emails as well as to write emails.

Now you can use your Gmail data, like this:

* searching for email:

    ```sql
    todo
    ```

* writing emails:

    ```sql
    todo
    ```
