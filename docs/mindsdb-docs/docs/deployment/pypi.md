# Deploy from PyPi

The recommended way is to always install inside a virtual environment when using `pip`. The `venv` provides an isolated Python environment, which is more practical than installing MindsDB systemwide. Follow below instructions depending on your operating system:

* [Linux](/deployment/linux)
* [Windows](/deployment/windows)
* [MacOS](/deployment/macos)
* [Source code](/deployment/source)
