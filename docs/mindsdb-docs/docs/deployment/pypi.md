# Deploy Using [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/MindsDB/)

The recommended way is to always install inside a virtual environment when using `#!bash pip`. The `#!bash venv` provides an isolated Python environment, which is more practical than installing MindsDB systemwide. Follow the instructions below depending on your operating system:

* [Linux](/deployment/linux)
* [Windows](/deployment/windows)
* [MacOS](/deployment/macos)
* [Source code](/deployment/source)
