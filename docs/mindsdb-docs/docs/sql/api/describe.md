# DESCRIBE statement

The `DESCRIBE ...` statement is used to display the attributes of an existing model.

## DESCRIBE FEATURES


The `DESCRIBE [...].features` statement is used to display the way that the model encoded the data prior to training.

### Syntax:

```sql
DESCRIBE [mindsdb.name_of_your_predictor].features;
```
### Expected Output

* column: name of the feature 
* type: binary integer... 
* encoder: name of the encoder used for that column
* role: describes whether the column is a target or a feature

## DESCRIBE MODEL  

`DESCRIBE [...].model` statement is used to display the performance of the candidate models.

### Syntax:

```sql
DESCRIBE [mindsdb.name_of_your_predictor].model;
```

### Expected Output


* name: name of the model
* performance : obtained accuracy (from 0.0 to 1.0) for that candidate model
* selected: the Auto ML pick the best performed candidate (1)
* training_time: training time for that candidate model

```sql
DESCRIBE [mindsdb.name_of_your_predictor].ensemble;
```

### Expected Output

ensemble: ensemble type used to select best model candidate
